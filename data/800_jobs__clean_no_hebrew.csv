Plus, the higher you rise in your organization, the less time you get to spend actually doing the technical work you love (and the more time you spend managing the people who are doing it).\n\n\n\n\nNot at Trilogy.\n\n\n\n\nIn this Product CTO role, you’ll have carte blanche to make architectural decisions based on technical merit — not whatever decision the board decided was most cost-effective. No more working on the same product every day for years, wishing you could go back in time and backhand whoever thought it was a good idea to write custom code for something that could’ve been purchased from AWS for $20/month.\n\n\n\n\nInstead, you’ll design for a diverse portfolio of products (hundreds, in fact) using the newest, most interesting cloud technologies. As a senior technical decision-maker, you’ll face a new architecture challenge each week and make important architectural decisions every day. Instead of tending to multiple stakeholders and a wishlist of features from customers, you decide the critical features for the product. Use and grow your expertise to design products for maximum performance, efficiency, and scale.\n\n\n\n\nReady to get back to doing the technical work you love, while guiding the development for products that reach millions of customers?\n\n\n\n\nWhat You Will Be Doing\n\n\n\n\nTackling design problems and writing technical specs to create products for distinct tech stacks and business domains.\nUncovering “high-order bit” decisions by interviewing technical leads and analyzing data structures and code/design documents.\nMaking important design and technical decisions that specify how to rearchitect products in a cloud-first way on systems such as AWS and GCP.\n\n\n\n\nWhat You Won’t Be Doing\n\n\n\n\nManaging projects or employees — thanks to Trilogy’s highly automated processes and streamlined org structure, there’s very little time spend on this type of admin\nParticipating in daily scrum meetings, making low-level decisions, performing code reviews, or debugging\nTalking to customers (while you’ll build products customers love, other roles in the organization will take care of these important interviews for you!)\nDeveloping a backlog of wishlist features\nCreating high-level strategies or roadmaps — instead, you’ll be making the rubber-meets-road tech decisions\n\n\n\n\nProduct CTO Key Responsibilities\n\n\n\n\nTear down current products, make key technical decisions for their rebuilding, and choose new product specs that simplify architecture. In essence, you’ll define a product and its features for the next 3 to 5 years.\n\n\n\n\nBasic Requirements\n\n\n\n\n7+ years of experience making important architecture and design decisions on software projects, such as the application of architecture design patterns or significant open source technologies.\nExperience making technical design decisions involving the use of cloud computing services\nExperience making technical design decisions for complex software products or systems\nAbility to simplify complex ideas and communicate them in writing with clear and logical thinking\n\n\n\n\nAbout Trilogy\n\n\n\n\nHundreds of software businesses run on the Trilogy Business Platform. For three decades, Trilogy has been known for 3 things: Relentlessly seeking top talent, Innovating new technology, and incubating new businesses. Our technological innovation is spearheaded by a passion for simple customer-facing designs. Our incubation of new businesses ranges from entirely new moon-shot ideas to rearchitecting existing projects for today's modern cloud-based stack.

Our clients offer top-tier pay for top-tier talent. We're recruiting this role for our client, Trilogy. Have you got what it takes?\n\n\n\n\nEvery technical decision-maker has the same gripes. The architecture is outdated. Past product decisions don’t make any sense. Technical debt is mounting. Plus, the higher you rise in your organization, the less time you get to spend actually doing the technical work you love (and the more time you spend managing the people who are doing it).\n\n\n\n\nNot at Trilogy.\n\n\n\n\nIn this Product CTO role, you’ll have carte blanche to make architectural decisions based on technical merit — not whatever decision the board decided was most cost-effective. No more working on the same product every day for years, wishing you could go back in time and backhand whoever thought it was a good idea to write custom code for something that could’ve been purchased from AWS for $20/month.\n\n\n\n\nInstead, you’ll design for a diverse portfolio of products (hundreds, in fact) using the newest, most interesting cloud technologies. As a senior technical decision-maker, you’ll face a new architecture challenge each week and make important architectural decisions every day. Instead of tending to multiple stakeholders and a wishlist of features from customers, you decide the critical features for the product. Use and grow your expertise to design products for maximum performance, efficiency, and scale.\n\n\n\n\nReady to get back to doing the technical work you love, while guiding the development for products that reach millions of customers?\n\n\n\n\nWhat You Will Be Doing\n\n\n\n\nTackling design problems and writing technical specs to create products for distinct tech stacks and business domains.\nUncovering “high-order bit” decisions by interviewing technical leads and analyzing data structures and code/design documents.\nMaking important design and technical decisions that specify how to rearchitect products in a cloud-first way on systems such as AWS and GCP.\n\n\n\n\nWhat You Won’t Be Doing\n\n\n\n\nManaging projects or employees — thanks to Trilogy’s highly automated processes and streamlined org structure, there’s very little time spend on this type of admin\nParticipating in daily scrum meetings, making low-level decisions, performing code reviews, or debugging\nTalking to customers (while you’ll build products customers love, other roles in the organization will take care of these important interviews for you!)\nDeveloping a backlog of wishlist features\nCreating high-level strategies or roadmaps — instead, you’ll be making the rubber-meets-road tech decisions\n\n\n\n\nCloud Architect Key Responsibilities\n\n\n\n\nTear down current products, make key technical decisions for their rebuilding, and choose new product specs that simplify architecture. In essence, you’ll define a product and its features for the next 3 to 5 years.\n\n\n\n\nBasic Requirements\n\n\n\n\n7+ years of experience making important architecture and design decisions on software projects, such as the application of architecture design patterns or significant open source technologies.\nExperience making technical design decisions involving the use of cloud computing services\nExperience making technical design decisions for complex software products or systems\nAbility to simplify complex ideas and communicate them in writing with clear and logical thinking\n\n\n\n\nAbout Trilogy\n\n\n\n\nHundreds of software businesses run on the Trilogy Business Platform.

Full Stack Developer,HUMAN,"Tel Aviv-Yafo, Tel Aviv District, Israel\nHybrid",263,"HUMAN was founded in 2012 in a Brooklyn sci-fi bookstore by Tamer Hassan, Michael Tiffany, Dan Kaminsky, and Ash Kalb. Our humble beginnings led to the creation of the Human Defense Platform, the backbone of all our products that safeguards enterprises from sophisticated bots, fraud, and account abuse. Today we verify the humanity of more than 20 trillion interactions per week for some of the largest companies and internet platforms.\n\n\n\n\nOur hacker roots still permeate everything we do. You will be a part of the HUMAN front line in our commitment to protecting companies (and in turn, their customers) from both revenue and reputation risk caused by digital attacks. However, HUMAN is not the center of this story. Humans like yourself are. We firmly believe in putting people first. This approach spans our extensive total rewards package, inclusive of competitive compensation, benefits, stipends - as well as our day-to-day culture - to ensure every human is empowered to do the best work of their life. We want to hear about the marathon you’re training for. We want to see pictures of your pets. We want to know your favorite robot (we have many).\n\n\n\n\nEven if you’re not a conventional “hacker” we can assure you that you are a hacker in your own right. We want to work with people like you who break down problems to build up better solutions. That’s what makes us HUMAN.\n\n\n\n\nYou’ll be joining us at an exciting moment in the HUMAN story: we joined forces with PerimeterX in a market-changing merger , as well as recently acquired clean.io to enhance the Human Defense Platform. Together under the HUMAN brand, we will disrupt the economics of cybercrime. We hope you can join us in that mission.\n\n\n\n\nWhat you'll do:\n\n\n\n\nWork on cutting-edge technologies and become an industry leader.\nTackle tough problems and find creative ways to solve them.\nCollaborate with different team members on shipping new features.\nHelp build the culture and foundation of the full-stack guild as we seek to grow and evolve.\nWork with product/designer and implement features UI and backend end to end.\n\n\n\n\nWho you are:\n\n\n\n\n3+ years of experience as a fullstack developer, with a strong understanding of frontend and backend technologies.\nProficiency in JavaScript, including modern language features and design patterns.\nExperience with React, including React-Query and other common libraries and tools.\nExperience with Node.js, including Express and other common libraries and tools.\nExperience with SQL and NoSQL databases - an advantage.\nExperience with building RESTful APIs - an advantage.\n\n\n\n\nLife at HUMAN:\n\n\n\n\nHUMAN prides itself on being an equal opportunity workplace. We firmly believe in putting people first regardless of who you are, where you come from, how you identify, or who your favorite robot is. We are on a mission to safeguard the internet for everyone, so we welcome all individuals to share their unique experiences and perspectives as we fight against cybercrime together.\n\n\n\n\nWith Humans located in all parts of the world, we’ve fully embraced our diversity of thought and are always looking for innovative ways to connect with one another - even in virtual reality! Although New York City is our HQ, with teams in Tel Aviv, London, Victoria, San Mateo, Miami, and Virginia we trust our Humans in choosing where they work and how they work. The benefits package we provide reflects our remote-first culture and our commitment to our Humans’ personal career development, which includes annual stipends for home office setup, wellbeing, and learning & development. We also offer weekly lunches, flexible time off, no-meeting Fridays, HUMAN days, sabbatical programs, and so much more.\n\n\n\n\nWe’re constantly trying to anticipate the needs of our Humans to ensure each one of us is equally prepared to do some of the best work of our life.

We're improving people's shared time by building the first Time Operating System for the new era of work. Details about us, the role, and the interview process are below.\n\nWho We Are.\n\nImagine a world with zero time waste — Less time on pointless meetings and more time on thinking, creating, and living.\n\nMagical is the world’s first Time Operating System that uses artificial intelligence to help you and your team reduce pointless meetings and focus on what matters.\n\nWe are here to solve the most time-wasting workflows at work:\n\n31 hours spent in unproductive meetings over a month\n1.8 hours every day spent searching and gathering information, especially before meetings.\n2 hours a day spent recovering from distraction per day\n\n\nWe are a hybrid company, which cares deeply about effective communication, community building, personal growth, ownership, curiosity, and great coffee 😊 (ok, we have tea lovers too)\n\nThe role.\n\nAs a Full Stack Engineer, you will:\n\nBe responsible for building new product features from the ground up: Shape. Design. Build. Think of features to improve team collaboration and focus, such as auto-scheduling, note-taking on events, and availability sharing.\nCreate a product that will redefine time management: Because we are dealing with the most scarce resource on earth - time, we have the chance to create the most leveraged and useful software of the last (or next) decade. You can help us realize this goal.\nTackle our most interesting and impactful problems: Our team is small, and people wear many hats. You'd jump between product, development, and process — participating in every phase from design to implementation. Absolutely no boredom.\nJoin us at a magical time: We've been exploring our product-market fit, which means you'll have a major impact. You'd join at the perfect time to shape what we build and how we grow.\n\n\nWe've put the developer experience in the front and center to allow you to do your best work frictionlessly. We mastered and tailored state-of-the-art methodologies such as Github flow, full CI/CD, and dynamic preview environments early on.\n\nRequirements\n\nYou have 5+ years of full-time development experience.\nYou've built and maintained beautiful and scalable user interfaces that have reached a large audience using React.\nYou have a track record of delivering scalable and reliable backend solutions and implementing REST API architecture. You are comfortable working with APIs and have a solid understanding of server-side languages and frameworks such as Python & Node.js.\nYou can readily learn most technologies as you go. To you, technologies are about tools and tradeoffs, not an ideology.\nYou care about the business implications of anything you build. You're not just going after cool stuff — you understand the balance between craft, speed, and the bottom line.\nYou are hungry to build products people love and are passionate about productivity and time.\nBonus: You're fluent with Typescript, Django, Postgres, Docker, K8S, and AWS.\n\n\nBenefits\n\nFreedom to do your best work:\n\n🏠 Setup your home office\n⛩ Access to our office in Tel Aviv\n👨‍💻 Flexible work hours\n\n\nTaking care of your future self:\n\n💰 Stock options\n✨ Personal growth roadmap\n\n\nAn IT stack to make your friends jealous:\n\n💻 Latest MacBook Pro\n⚡️ Premium productivity tools\n\n\nLooking after your present self:\n\n🏝 Generous Paid Time Off\n🧘🏼‍♂️ Sleep & wellness practices",Magical,https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/3418744716/,1 week ago,2023-01-07T08:31:56.938Z
