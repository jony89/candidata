Registered users interact with other users through in-game or website chat, personal messaging (within the Roblox environment), user forums, groups, and other similar features, with available privacy settings designed to allow users to restrict or disable communications with other users. 		Each user is given one or more pieces of virtual real estate on which they can build houses, cars, machines, roller coasters, or anything else you can imagine with building blocks and code; these places are called “games.” 		Users search for, find, and play games made by other users; they play these games with other users from around the world, and are identified only by their username. 		The Roblox world includes a virtual currency known as Robux; users can earn or purchase Robux in a variety of ways, and use them to buy or sell items for their characters, for in-game items, and other uses. 		Users who earn a large amount of Robux virtual currency are allowed to sell that currency back to Roblox subject to certain participation requirements.
