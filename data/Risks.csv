Generally, our Services are not directed to children under 13 (or other age as required by local law), and the Services do not knowingly collect personal data from children, except as described in the following paragraph.

For these Services, when a player indicates they are under 13 (or the applicable age in their territory), we will limit their access to certain features, such as social media and chat features, as well as certain types of notification alerts. We also limit the processing of personal data to only what is necessary to support the internal operations of our Services.

We don't like reading license documents any more than you do, so we have tried to keep this as short as possible. If you break these rules we may stop you from using our Game. If we think it is necessary, we might even have to ask our lawyers to help out.If you buy, download, use or play our Game, you are agreeing to stick to the rules of these end user license agreement (""EULA"") terms. If you don't want to or can't agree to these rules, then you must not buy, download, use or play our Game. This EULA incorporates the the terms of use for the mojang.com website (""Account Terms""), our brand and asset usage guidelines, and our our privacy policy. By agreeing to this EULA you also agree to all of the terms of the foregoing documents, so please read through them carefully. - Selected Choice",0,Limited readability
Minecraft,2,TOS,"ONE MAJOR RULE    The one major rule is that you must not distribute anything we've made unless we specifically agree to it. By ""distribute anything we've made"" what we mean is:  	give copies of our Game to anyone else; 	make commercial use of anything we've made; 	try to make money from anything we've made; or 	let other people get access to anything we've made in a way that is unfair or unreasonable;  unless we specifically agree to it. And so that we are crystal clear, ""the Game"" or ""what we have made"" includes, but is not limited to, the client or the server software for our Game and includes Minecraft and Minecraft: Java Edition on all platforms. It also includes updates, patches, downloadable content, add-ons, or modified versions of a Game, part of those things, or anything else we've made.  Otherwise we are quite relaxed about what you do - in fact we really encourage you to do cool stuff - but just don't do those things that we say you can't. - Selected Choice",1,NA
Minecraft,3,TOS,"USING OUR GAME   You have been granted a license to the Game so you can play and use it, yourself, on your devices.  Below we also give you limited rights to do other things but we have to draw a line somewhere or else people will go too far. If you wish to make something pertaining to anything we've made we're humbled, but please make sure that it can't be interpreted as being official and that it complies with this EULA and the brand and asset usage guidelines and above all do not make commercial use of anything we've made.  The license and permission we give you to use and play our Game can be revoked if you break any of the terms of this EULA.  When you buy our Game, you receive a license that gives you permission to install the Game on your own personal device and use and play it on that device as set out in this EULA. This permission is personal to you, so you are not allowed to distribute the Game (or any part of it) to anyone else. This also means you cannot sell or rent the Game, or make it available for access to other people and you cannot pass on or resell any license keys. You may however give gift codes that have been bought through our official gift code system. This is important to help us stop piracy and fraud and to protect our Game. It is also important to prevent members of our community from buying pirated versions of our Game or fraudulent license keys - which we may cancel, such as in the case of fraud.  If you've bought the Game, you may play around with it and modify it by adding modifications, tools, or plugins, which we will refer to collectively as ""Mods."" By ""Mods,"" we mean something original that you or someone else created that doesn't contain a substantial part of our copyrightable code or content. When you combine your Mod with the Minecraft software, we will call that combination a ""Modded Version"" of the Game. We have the final say on what constitutes a Mod and what doesn't. You may not distribute any Modded Versions of our Game or software, and we'd appreciate it if you didn't use Mods for griefing. Basically, Mods are okay to distribute; hacked versions or Modded Versions of the Game client or server software are not okay to distribute.  Within reason you're free to do whatever you want with screenshots and videos of the Game. By ""within reason"" we mean that you can't make any commercial use of them or do things that are unfair or adversely affect our rights unless we've specifically said it's okay in this EULA, allowed it through the Brand and Asset Usage Guidelines, or provided for it in a specific agreement with you. If you upload videos of the game to video sharing and streaming sites you are however allowed to put ads on them. Also, don't just rip art resources and pass them around, that's no fun.  Essentially the simple rule is do not make commercial use of anything we've made unless we've specifically said it's okay. Oh and if the law expressly allows it, such as under a ""fair use"" or fair dealing"" doctrine then that's ok too - but only to the extent that the law applicable to you says so.  In order to ensure the integrity of the Game, we need all Game downloads and updates to come from an authorized source. It's also important for us that 3rd party tools/services don't seem ""official"" as we can't guarantee their quality. It's part of the responsibility we have to the customers of Minecraft.

Some examples of the types of things you must not make available using our Game include: posts that include racist or homophobic language; posts that are bullying or trolling; posts that are offensive or that damage our or another person's reputation; posts that include porn or someone else's creation or image; or posts that impersonate a moderator or try to trick or exploit people.

We may change this EULA from time to time, if we have reason to, such as changes to our games, our practices, or our legal obligation.

In that case we'll inform you of the change before it takes effect, either by posting a notice on our Website or by other reasonable means.

Google Analytics collects only the IP address assigned to you on the date you visit a Service, rather than your name or other identifying information. Plarium does not combine the information collected through the use of Google Analytics with personal information. Although Google Analytics plants a permanent cookie on your web browser to identify you as a unique user the next time you visit a Service, the cookie cannot be used by anyone but Google.  Google’s ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics about your visits to our Service is restricted by the Google Analytics Terms of Use (as amended for government websites) and the Google Privacy Policy.

Furthermore, you can change or delete any personal information by changing the applicable information found in your Plarium account. However, if you decide to delete or anonymize your personal information, you may no longer have access to certain content (e.g. information of your game progress) and your account may become deactivated.  In certain territories (including the EU), you also have a legal right to ask for a restriction of processing, to object to processing as well as the right to data portability. However, these rights are subject to conditions and may not always be applicable.  You have the right to withdraw your consent, on the basis of which we process your personal information, at any time, by closing your account or otherwise clearly indicating your withdrawal of consent.

You may also go to the Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) Consumer Opt-Out Page for information about opting out of interest-based advertising and your choices regarding having information used by NAI members.

For example, users in France may go to the Contrôler ses cookies website to opt out of certain third-party ad networks’ interest-based advertising and find additional information at www.youronlinechoices.com/fr.  Opting out from one or more companies listed on the DAA Consumer Choice Page, the NAI Consumer Opt-Out Page, or through the various EDAA websites will opt you out from those companies’ delivery of interest-based content or ads to you, but it does not mean you will no longer receive any advertising through our Site or App or on other websites. You may continue to receive advertisements, for example, based on the particular website that you are viewing (i.e., contextually based ads).

In the Services you may use “real world” money to obtain a limited license and right to use Virtual Items and/or other goods or services.  How it Works:  You get a limited license and right to use Virtual Items by visiting the purchase page in one of our games or Services and providing billing authorization through the platform on which you are playing (e.g., Facebook, Apple, Google).  When you make a purchase on Zyngagames.com, zyngapoker.com, gotslotscasino.znyga.com or any Zynga-owned website, the payment page will let you know what payment methods you can use to pay when you make your purchase. The price of the product will be the price indicated on the order page when you place your order. When your purchase is complete, we may send you a confirmation email that will have details of the items you have ordered. Please check that the details in the confirmation message are correct as soon as possible and keep a copy of it for your records. Zynga keeps records of Zyngagames.com transactions in order to handle any future questions about that transaction.  When you purchase Virtual Items in our games on other platforms such as Facebook, Apple, or Google, Zynga is not a party to the transaction and your purchase will be governed by the third-party platform’s payment terms and conditions. Please review the platform’s terms of service for additional information.

Any “virtual currency” balance shown in your Account does not constitute a real-world balance or reflect any stored value, but instead constitutes a measurement of the extent of your limited license.

ZyngaPoker,22,TOS,"AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER    THIS SECTION ONLY APPLIES TO PLAYERS IN THE US AND CANADA.  If you are having a problem with the Services, many issues can be resolved on one of our player forums.  Before bringing a formal legal case, you must first contact our Customer Support team at https://www.zynga.com/support. In the event that you and Zynga can’t resolve the dispute through Customer Service, you and Zynga both agree to arbitrate as described below.  You and Zynga Both Agree to Arbitrate  By voluntarily accepting these Terms (and in many of our Services by voluntarily clicking or tapping an in-game button to affirmatively indicate your agreement to these Terms), you, Zynga, and any member of the Zynga Corporate Family all agree to the fullest extent permitted by law to resolve any claims arising out of, relating to, or in connection with the Terms, Feature Terms, Community Rules, your relationship with us, or Zynga’s Services, including but not limited to your use of the Services and information you provide via the Services, through final and binding arbitration. This applies to all claims under any legal theory, unless the claim fits within the Exceptions to Agreement to Arbitrate identified below. This agreement to arbitrate also applies even after you stop using your Zynga account or delete it. (In this Section 15 and in Section 17, you, Zynga, and any member of the Zynga Corporate Family may be referred to individually as “a party” or collectively as “the parties.”)  An arbitration proceeding is before a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge and jury, so by voluntarily accepting these Terms, you, Zynga, and any member of the Zynga Corporate Family all agree to give up the right to a trial before a judge and jury. Arbitrations have different rules from lawsuits in court. They are less formal than lawsuits in courts and provide limited opportunities to force the other side to share information relevant to the dispute—a process called discovery. The arbitrator can award the same damages and relief on an individual basis that a court can award to an individual. But, if any party does not like the arbitrator’s decision, the courts only have a limited ability to change the outcome of arbitration or make the arbitrator reconsider his or her decision.  If any party disagrees about whether this Section 15 (or any portion of this Section 15, including without limitation the provisions relating to arbitration, class action waiver, and opting out) can be enforced or whether it applies to the dispute, the parties all agree that the arbitrator will decide that, too.  In addition, if you, Zynga, or a Zynga Corporate Family member brings a claim in court that should be arbitrated, or any party refuses to arbitrate a claim that should be arbitrated, any other party can ask a court to force the parties to go to arbitration to resolve the claim (i.e., compel arbitration). You, Zynga, or the Zynga Corporate Family member may also ask a court to halt a court proceeding (i.e., stay the court proceedings) while an arbitration proceeding is ongoing.  n of these Terms. - Selected Choice",0,Restricting User Legal Action
ZyngaPoker,23,TOS,"The Arbitration ProcessThe American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) will control any arbitration between you and Zynga or the Zynga Corporate Family member, and AAA’s then-current rules and procedures, including the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes, will be used. You can look at AAA’s rules and procedures on their website at www.adr.org. If something in these Terms is different from AAA’s rules and procedures, then the parties agree to follow these Terms instead. To start an arbitration proceeding, use the form on AAA’s website (www.adr.org).  If you reside outside of the United States, arbitration may take place in the county where you reside at the time of filing. If you reside in the United States, arbitration shall be initiated in the State of California, United States of America. You and Zynga further agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of any federal or state court in San Francisco County, California in order to compel arbitration, to stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.  If your claim is for ten thousand dollars ($10,000) or less, we agree that you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules. If your claim exceeds ten thousand dollars ($10,000), the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules.  Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator costs and expenses imposed by AAA will be governed by the AAA rules, provided that if you are initiating an arbitration against Zynga or a member of the Zynga Corporate Family and the value of the relief sought is ten thousand dollars ($10,000) or less, then Zynga will advance all filing, administrative, and arbitration costs and expenses imposed by AAA (subject to reimbursement as set forth below). If the circumstances in the preceding sentence apply, but the value of relief sought is more than ten thousand dollars ($10,000) and you demonstrate to the arbitrator that such costs and expenses would be prohibitively more expensive than a court proceeding, then Zynga will pay the amount of any such costs and expenses that the arbitrator determines are necessary to prevent the arbitration from being prohibitively more expensive than a court proceeding (subject to reimbursement as set forth below). In the event that the arbitrator determines that all of the claims you assert in arbitration are frivolous according to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11, you agree to reimburse Zynga for all such cost and expenses that Zynga paid and that you would have been obligated to pay under the AAA rules. - Selected Choice",0,Restricting User Legal Action
ZyngaPoker,24,TOS,"Exceptions to Agreement to Arbitrate  The parties all agree that they will go to court to resolve disputes  	Relating to your, Zynga’s, or a Zynga Corporate Family member’s intellectual property (for example, trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights, or patents); 	Relating to any violation of the Community Rules; 	Where the sole form of relief sought is injunctive relief; or 	Within the jurisdiction of small claims courts.   For more information about which court the parties can go to for resolving these types of disputes, see Section 17 (Venue for Legal Disputes Not Subject to Arbitration).  No Class Actions  By voluntarily accepting these Terms (and in many of our Services by voluntarily clicking or tapping an in-game button to affirmatively indicate your agreement to these Terms), you, Zynga, and the Zynga Corporate Family all agree that the parties can only bring a claim against each other on an individual basis.  That means:  ·  The parties agree that neither you nor Zynga nor any member of the Zynga Corporate Family can bring a claim as a plaintiff or class member in a class action, consolidated action, or representative action.  ·  The parties agree that the arbitrator cannot combine more than one person’s claim into a single case, and cannot preside over any consolidated, class, or representative arbitration proceeding (unless the parties all agree to change this).  ·  The parties agree that the arbitrator’s decision or award in one person’s case can only impact the person who brought the claim, not other Zynga players, and cannot be used to decide other disputes with other players.  If this subsection on “No Class Actions” is found to not be enforceable or valid, then the entire Section 15 (Agreement to Arbitrate and Class Action Waiver) will be null and void (i.e., go away). But the rest of the Terms, Feature Terms, and Community Rules will still apply.  Opting out of the Agreement to Arbitrate and Class Action Waiver  You have the right to opt out and not be bound by the arbitration and class action waiver provisions in this Section 15 by sending us written notice of your decision to opt out through Customer Support or by physical mail as stated in Notices. The notice must be sent within thirty (30) days of your first use of the Services or availability of this opt-out, whichever is later; otherwise, you shall be bound to arbitrate disputes as set out in this Section 15. If you opt out of these arbitration provisions, Zynga also will not be bound by them.  Changes to Section 15 Agreement to Arbitrate and Class Action Waiver  We will give you 60-days’ notice by email or through the Services if we change this Section 15 on our Agreement to Arbitrate and Class Action Waiver. If this subsection on “Changes to Section 15 on Agreement to Arbitrate and Class Action Waiver” is found to not be enforceable or valid, then this subsection shall be severed from Section 15, and the court or arbitrator shall apply the first Agreement to Arbitrate and Class Action Waiver section in existence after you began using the Services.  Survival  This Section 15 shall survive termination of these Terms. - Selected Choice",0,Restricting User Legal Action
